## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
Detailed Explanation of the Solution

The proposed solution is a Smart Crop Advisory System in the form of a mobile app and chatbot that integrates AI, geolocation, computer vision, and local language support. It offers:

Personalized Crop Advice: Based on soil type, weather, crop history, and user location.

Fertilizer and Irrigation Planning: AI recommendations tailored to crop stage and local conditions.

Disease/Pest Diagnosis: Farmers can upload pictures of affected crops, and the system identifies issues with treatment suggestions.

Weather Forecasting: Weather-based alerts like rainfall prediction, frost warnings, or pest outbreak alerts.

Mandi Price Updates: Live tracking of nearby market prices for various crops.

Voice Assistance: Enables farmers with limited literacy to access full functionality through spoken commands and responses.

How It Addresses the Problem

Localized and Real-Time: Uses geolocation and weather APIs to provide area-specific guidance.

Inclusive Design: Supports multiple Indian languages with voice interfaces.

Affordable & Scalable: A digital solution that works on low-end Android devices with offline fallback modes.

Self-Sustaining: Feedback loop from farmers helps train and improve AI models continuously.

Innovation and Uniqueness

AI-based image detection for disease diagnosis via smartphone camera.

Natural Language Understanding (NLU) for regional dialects.

Gamified education and nudges to improve digital adoption among farmers.

Crowdsourced advisory feature where farmers share localized tips (moderated by agri experts).

## Technical Approach
Technologies to Be Used

Frontend: React Native / Flutter for cross-platform mobile development

Backend: Node.js + Express / Django for API services

Database: Firebase / MongoDB / PostgreSQL

Machine Learning: TensorFlow / PyTorch (for disease detection and recommendation engines)

NLP/Voice: Google Cloud Dialogflow / Microsoft Azure Speech Services / Bhashini API (for Indian languages)

Image Processing: OpenCV + CNN models for crop disease identification

APIs:

IMD/Weather API for weather forecasting

Agmarknet API for mandi price updates

Soil Health Card API for soil data access (where available)

Methodology & Implementation Process
Flow Chart Overview:

User Registration
→ Select language, enter location, choose crop(s)

Home Dashboard
→ Display personalized tips, weather, and price updates

Soil & Crop Advisory Module
→ Inputs: Soil health, previous crops
→ Output: Crop recommendations, irrigation & fertilizer plan

Disease Detection Module
→ Upload Image → AI Classifier → Suggest pesticide/remedy

Weather Alert Module
→ Pulls local data → Pushes SMS/voice alerts

Market Price Module
→ Tracks live mandi prices → Suggests optimal sell time

Voice Assistant
→ Farmers speak in native language → Get spoken advice back

Prototype / UI Screens (To Be Developed):

Login & Language Selection

Dashboard with Real-Time Weather, Crop Tips

Camera Upload for Pest Detection

Market Price Viewer

Voice Interaction Interface

## Feasibility and Viability
Feasibility Analysis

Technical: Readily implementable using existing technologies

Financial: Can be deployed as an open-source MVP, later scaled through PPP models

Operational: Can partner with Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs), Agri Universities, or NGOs for pilot testing

Challenges & Mitigation Strategies
Challenge	Strategy
Poor connectivity in rural areas	App supports offline mode with periodic sync
Limited smartphone usage	Voice-first design with call-based access
Regional diversity	NLP models trained for multiple Indian languages
Trust in digital tools	Include human experts via hybrid advisory model

## Impact and Benefits
Target Audience Impact

Small and marginal farmers gain access to reliable, scientific, and real-time farming advice.

Government and agri officers get actionable data to improve extension services.

NGOs and cooperatives benefit from a scalable, low-cost outreach tool.

Benefits

Social: Reduces farmer distress by minimizing crop failures

Economic: Optimizes input costs, improves yields, increases profitability

Environmental: Reduces excessive chemical usage and promotes sustainable farming
